We strongly recommend that you ask support questions in the community forum:
[Community Forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/). That includes problems with SonarQube / SonarCloud analysis, code coverage import problems, etc.
If you have a question on how to use the analyzer or plugin (and the docs don't help you) or how to create custom rules, we also encourage you to use the community forum.
The community forum is monitored by more SonarSourcers and community members so your question is likely to be answered more quickly (if the answer isn't already available in the forum).
