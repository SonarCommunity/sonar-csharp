# Contributing to SonarC#
One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions and discuss issues. You can also contribute by
submitting pull requests with code changes.

## General feedback and discussions?
Even if you plan to implement a new rule or fix one by yourself and then submit it back to the community, please start
by creating a new GitHub Issue to get some early feedback on this idea.

## Pull Request (PR)
To submit a contribution, create a pull request for this repository. Please make sure that you follow our [code style](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-developer-toolset#code-style)

## Custom Rules
If you have an idea for a rule but you are not sure that everyone needs it you can implement a
[custom rule](https://github.com/SonarSource-VisualStudio/sonarqube-roslyn-sdk) available only for you.
