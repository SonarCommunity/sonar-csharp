/// <summary>
/// Data structure for working with disjoint sets of strings, to perform union-find operations with equality semantics:
/// i.e. reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity.
///
/// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure for an introduction to the data structure and
/// https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-disjoint-set-data-structure-or-union-find-algorithm/ for examples of
/// its use.
///
/// An example of use is to build undirected connected components of dependencies, where each node is the identifier.
///
/// Uses a dictionary of strings as a backing store. The dictionary represents a forest of trees, where each node is
/// a string and each tree is a set of nodes.
