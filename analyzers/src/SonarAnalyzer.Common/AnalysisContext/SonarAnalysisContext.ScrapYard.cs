/// SonarC# and SonarVB specific context for initializing an analyzer. This type acts as a wrapper around Roslyn

/// Here is the list of fine-grained changes we are doing:
/// - Avoid duplicated issues when the analyzer NuGet (SonarAnalyzer) and the VSIX (SonarLint) are installed simultaneously.
/// - Allow a specific kind of rule-set for SonarLint (enable/disable a rule).
/// - Prevent reporting an issue when it was suppressed on SonarQube.
