<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Shadowing occurs when a local variable has the same name as a variable, field, or property in an outer scope.</p>
<p>This can lead to three main problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Confusion: The same name can refer to different variables in different parts of the scope, making the code hard to read and understand. </li>
  <li> Unintended Behavior: You might accidentally use the wrong variable, leading to hard-to-detect bugs. </li>
  <li> Maintenance Issues: If the inner variable is removed or renamed, the codeâ€™s behavior might change unexpectedly because the outer variable is
  now being used. </li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid these problems, rename the shadowing, shadowed, or both variables/fields/properties to accurately represent their purpose with unique and
meaningful names. It improves clarity and allows reasoning locally about the code without considering other software parts.</p>
<p>This rule focuses on variables shadowing fields or properties.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
class Foo
{
  public int myField;
  public int MyProperty { get; set; }

  public void DoSomething()
  {
    int myField = 0;    // Noncompliant
    int MyProperty = 0; // Noncompliant
  }
}
</pre>
