<p>In frequently used code paths, such as controller actions, you should avoid using the <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient">HttpClient</a> directly and opt for <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory">one of the IHttpClientFactory-based mechanisms</a> instead. This
way, you avoid wasting resources and creating performance overhead.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>If a code path that creates and disposes of HttpClient objects is frequently used, then the following issues can occur:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Under heavy load, there’s the risk of <a
  href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/networking/http/httpclient-guidelines#pooled-connections">running out of available
  sockets</a>, leading to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.socketexception">SocketException</a> errors. This
  is because each HttpClient instance uses a separate network connection, and there’s a limit to the number of connections that can be opened
  simultaneously. Note that even after you dispose of an HttpClient <a
  href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/use-httpclientfactory-to-implement-resilient-http-requests#issues-with-the-original-httpclient-class-available-in-net">its sockets are not immediately freed up</a>. </li>
  <li> Each HttpClient has its own set of resources (like headers, base address, timeout, etc.) that must be managed. Creating a new HttpClient for
  every request means these resources are not being reused, leading to resource waste. </li>
  <li> You introduce a significant performance overhead when creating a new HttpClient for every HTTP request. </li>
</ul>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.ihttpclientfactory"><code>IHttpClientFactory</code></a> was introduced in
ASP.NET Core 2.1 to solve these problems. It handles pooling HTTP connections to optimize performance and reliability.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests#consumption-patterns">several ways</a> that you can use
IHttpClientFactory in your application:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory#basic-usage">Basic usage</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory#named-clients">Named Clients</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory#typed-clients">Typed Clients</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory#generated-clients">Generated Clients</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you may cache the HttpClient in a singleton or a static field. You should be aware that by default, the HttpClient doesn’t respect
the DNS’s Time To Live (TTL) settings. If the IP address associated with a domain name changes, HttpClient might still use the old, cached IP address,
leading to failed requests.</p>
