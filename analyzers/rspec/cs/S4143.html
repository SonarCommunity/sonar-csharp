<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Storing a value inside a collection at a given key or index and then unconditionally overwriting it without reading the initial value is a case of
"dead store".</p>
<pre>
list[index] = "value 1";
list[index] = "value 2";  // Noncompliant

dictionary.Add(key, "value 1");
dictionary[key] = "value 2"; // Noncompliant
</pre>
<p>At best it is redundant and will confuse the reader, most often it is an error and not what the developer intended to do.</p>
