<p>This rule raises an issue when the code cognitive complexity of a function is above a certain threshold.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Cognitive Complexity is a measure of how hard it is to understand the control flow of a unit of code. Code with high cognitive complexity is hard
to read, understand, test, and modify.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, high cognitive complexity is a sign that the code should be refactored into smaller, easier-to-manage pieces.</p>
<h3>Which syntax in code does impact cognitive complexity score?</h3>
<p>Here are the core concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Cognitive complexity is incremented each time the code breaks the normal linear reading flow.</strong><br> This concerns, for example:
  Loop structures, Conditionals, Catches, Switches, Jumps to label and mixed operators in condition. </li>
  <li> <strong>Each nesting level adds a malus to the breaking call.</strong><br> During code reading, the deeper you go through nested layers, the
  harder it becomes to keep the context in mind. </li>
  <li> <strong>Method calls are free</strong><br> A well-picked method name is a summary of multiple lines of code. A reader can first explore a
  high-level view of what the code is performing then go deeper and deeper by looking at called functions content.<br> <em>Note:</em> This does not
  apply to recursive calls, those will increment cognitive score. </li>
</ul>
<p>The method of computation is fully detailed in the pdf linked in the resources.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Developers spend more time reading and understanding code than writing it. High cognitive complexity slows down changes and increases the cost of
maintenance.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Reducing cognitive complexity can be challenging.<br> Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Extract complex conditions in a new function.</strong><br> Mixed operators in condition will increase complexity. Extracting the
  condition in a new function with an appropriate name will reduce cognitive load. </li>
  <li> <strong>Break down large functions.</strong><br> Large functions can be hard to understand and maintain. If a function is doing too many
  things, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions. Each function should have a single responsibility. </li>
  <li> <strong>Avoid deep nesting by returning early.</strong><br> To avoid the nesting of conditions, process exceptional cases first and return
  early. </li>
  <li> <strong>Use null-safe operations (if available in the language).</strong><br> When available the <code>.?</code> or <code>??</code> operator
  replaces multiple tests and simplifies the flow. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<p><strong>Extraction of a complex condition in a new function.</strong></p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<p>The code is using a complex condition and has a cognitive cost of 3.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
decimal CalculateFinalPrice(User user, Cart cart)
{
    decimal total = CalculateTotal(cart);
    if (user.HasMembership()               // +1 (if)
        &amp;&amp; user.OrdersCount &gt; 10           // +1 (more than one condition)
        &amp;&amp; user.AccountActive
        &amp;&amp; !user.HasDiscount
        || user.OrdersCount == 1)          // +1 (change of operator in condition)
    {

        total = ApplyDiscount(user, total);
    }
    return total;
}
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<p>Even if the cognitive complexity of the whole program did not change, it is easier for a reader to understand the code of the
<code>calculateFinalPrice</code> function, which now only has a cognitive cost of 1.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
decimal CalculateFinalPrice(User user, Cart cart)
{
    decimal total = CalculateTotal(cart);
    if (IsEligibleForDiscount(user))       // +1 (if)
    {
        total = applyDiscount(user, total);
    }
    return total;
}

bool IsEligibleForDiscount(User user)
{
    return user.HasMembership()
            &amp;&amp; user.OrdersCount &gt; 10       // +1 (more than one condition)
            &amp;&amp; user.AccountActive
            &amp;&amp; !user.HasDiscount
            || user.OrdersCount == 1;      // +1 (change of operator in condition)
}
</pre>
<p><strong>Break down large functions.</strong></p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<p>For example, consider a function that calculates the total price of a shopping cart, including sales tax and shipping.<br> <em>Note:</em> The code
is simplified here, to illustrate the purpose. Please imagine there is more happening in the <code>foreach</code> loops.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="3" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
decimal CalculateTotal(Cart cart)
{
    decimal total = 0;
    foreach (Item item in cart.Items) // +1 (foreach)
    {
        total += item.Price;
    }

    // calculateSalesTax
    foreach (Item item in cart.Items) // +1 (foreach)
    {
        total += 0.2m * item.Price;
    }

    //calculateShipping
    total += 5m * cart.Items.Count;

    return total;
}
</pre>
<p>This function could be refactored into smaller functions: The complexity is spread over multiple functions and the complex
<code>CalculateTotal</code> has now a complexity score of zero.</p>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="3" data-diff-type="compliant">
decimal CalculateTotal(Cart cart)
{
    decimal total = 0;
    total = CalculateSubtotal(cart, total);
    total += CalculateSalesTax(cart, total);
    total += CalculateShipping(cart, total);
    return total;
}

decimal CalculateSubtotal(Cart cart, decimal total)
{
    foreach (Item item in cart.Items) // +1 (foreach)
    {
        total += item.Price;
    }

    return total;
}

decimal CalculateSalesTax(Cart cart, decimal total)
{
    foreach (Item item in cart.Items)  // +1 (foreach)
    {
        total += 0.2m * item.Price;
    }

    return total;
}

decimal CalculateShipping(Cart cart, decimal total)
{
    total += 5m * cart.Items.Count;
    return total;
}
</pre>
<p><strong>Avoid deep nesting by returning early.</strong></p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<p>The below code has a cognitive complexity of 6.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="4" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
decimal CalculateDiscount(decimal price, User user)
{
    if (IsEligibleForDiscount(user))    // +1 ( if )
    {
        if (user.HasMembership())       // +2 ( nested if )
        {
            return price * 0.9m;
        }
        else if (user.OrdersCount == 1) // +1 ( else )
        {
            return price * 0.95m;
        }
        else                            // +1 ( else )
        {
            return price;
        }
    }
    else                                // +1 ( else )
    {
        return price;
    }
}
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<p>Checking for the edge case first flattens the <code>if</code> statements and reduces the cognitive complexity to 3.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="4" data-diff-type="compliant">
decimal CalculateDiscount(decimal price, User user)
{
    if (!IsEligibleForDiscount(user)) // +1 ( if )
    {
        return price;
    }

    if (user.HasMembership())         // +1 (  if )
    {
        return price * 0.9m;
    }

    if (user.OrdersCount == 1)        // +1 ( else )
    {
        return price * 0.95m;
    }

    return price;
}
</pre>
<p><strong>Use the null-conditional operator to access data.</strong></p>
<p>In the below code, the cognitive complexity is increased due to the multiple checks required to access the manufacturerâ€™s name. This can be
simplified using the optional chaining operator.</p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
string GetManufacturerName(Product product)
{
    string manufacturerName = null;
    if (product != null &amp;&amp; product.Details != null &amp;&amp;
        product.Details.Manufacturer != null) // +1 (if) +1 (multiple condition)
    {
        manufacturerName = product.Details.Manufacturer.Name;
    }

    if (manufacturerName != null) // +1 (if)
    {
        return manufacturerName;
    }

    return "Unknown";
}
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<p>The optional chaining operator will return <code>null</code> if any reference in the chain is <code>null</code>, avoiding multiple checks. The
<code>??</code> operator allows to provide the default value to use.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="compliant">
string GetManufacturerName(Product product)
{
    return product?.Details?.Manufacturer?.Name ?? "Unknown";
}
</pre>
