<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>When an assembly uses Windows Forms (classes and interfaces from the <code>System.Windows.Forms</code> namespace) its entry point should be marked
with the <code>STAThreadAttribute</code> to indicate that the threading model should be "Single-Threaded Apartment" (STA) which is the only one
supported by Windows Forms.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when the entry point (<code>Shared Sub Main</code> method) of an assembly using Windows Forms is not marked as STA.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
Imports System.Windows.Forms

Public Class Foo
  Shared Sub Main()
    Dim winForm As Form = New Form
    Application.Run(winForm)
  End Sub
End Class
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
Imports System.Windows.Forms

Public Class Foo
  &lt;STAThread()&gt; Shared Sub Main()
    Dim winForm As Form = New Form
    Application.Run(winForm)
  End Sub
End Class
</pre>
