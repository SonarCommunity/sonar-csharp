<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Nested code - blocks of code inside blocks of code - is eventually necessary, but increases complexity. This is why keeping the code as flat as
possible, by avoiding unnecessary nesting, is considered a good practice.</p>
<p>Merging <code>if</code> statements when possible will decrease the nesting of the code and improve its readability.</p>
<p>Code like</p>
<pre>
If condition1 Then
    If condition2 Then ' Noncompliant
        ' ...
    End If
End If
</pre>
<p>Will be more readable as</p>
<pre>
If condition1 AndAlso condition2 Then
    ' ...
End If
</pre>
