<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Nested ternaries are hard to read and can make the order of operations complex to understand.</p>
<pre>
Public Function GetReadableStatus(job As Job) As String
    Return If(job.IsRunning, "Running", If(job.HasErrors, "Failed", "Succeeded")) ' Noncompliant
End Function
</pre>
<p>Instead, use another line to express the nested operation in a separate statement.</p>
<pre>
Public Function GetReadableStatus(job As Job) As String
    If job.IsRunning Then Return "Running"
    Return If(job.HasErrors, "Failed", "Succeeded")
End Function
</pre>
