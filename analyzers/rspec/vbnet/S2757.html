<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Using operator pairs (<code>=+</code> or <code>=-</code>) that look like reversed single operators (<code>+=</code> or <code>-=</code>) is
confusing. They compile and run but do not produce the same result as their mirrored counterpart.</p>
<pre>
Dim target As Integer = -5
Dim num As Integer = 3

target =- num ' Noncompliant: target = -3. Is that the intended behavior?
target =+ num ' Noncompliant: target = 3
</pre>
<p>This rule raises an issue when <code>=+</code> or <code>=-</code> are used without any space between the operators and when there is at least one
whitespace after.</p>
<p>Replace the operators with a single one if that is the intention</p>
<pre>
Dim num As Integer = 3

target -= num  ' target = -8
</pre>
<p>Or fix the spacing to avoid confusion</p>
<pre>
Dim num As Integer = 3

target = -num  // target = -3
</pre>
