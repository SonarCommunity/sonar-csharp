<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A long parameter list can indicate that a new structure should be created to wrap the numerous parameters or that the procedure is doing too many
things.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<p>With a maximum number of 3 parameters:</p>
<pre>
Public Sub Foo(ByVal p1 As Integer, ByVal p2 As Integer, ByVal p3 As Integer, ByVal p4 As Integer) ' Noncompliant
  ' ...
End Sub

Public Function Bar(ByVal p1 As Integer, ByVal p2 As Integer, ByVal p3 As Integer, ByVal p4 As Integer) ' Noncompliant
  ' ...
End Function
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
Public Sub Foo(ByVal p1 As Integer, ByVal p2 As Integer, ByVal p3 As Integer)
  ' ...
End Sub

Public Function Bar(ByVal p1 As Integer, ByVal p2 As Integer, ByVal p3 As Integer)
  ' ...
End Function
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<pre>
Public Class BaseClass
    Public Sub New(Param1 As Integer)
        ' ...
    End Sub
End Class

Public Class DerivedClass
    Inherits BaseClass

    Public Sub New(Param1 As Integer, Param2 As Integer, Param3 As Integer, Param4 As Integer, Param5 As Long)
        MyBase.New(Param1) ' Compliant, the parameters intended for the base class constructor do not count in the sum of the parameter list.
        ' ...
    End Sub

End Class
