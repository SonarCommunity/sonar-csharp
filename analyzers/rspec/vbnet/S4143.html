<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Storing a value inside a collection at a given key or index and then unconditionally overwriting it without reading the initial value is a case of
a "dead store".</p>
<pre>
towns.Item(x) = "London"
towns.Item(x) = "Chicago";  // Noncompliant
</pre>
<p>This practice is redundant and will cause confusion for the reader. More importantly, it is often an error and not what the developer intended to
do.</p>
