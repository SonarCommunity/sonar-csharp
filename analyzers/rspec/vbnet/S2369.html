<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. This rule checks that all non-private fields names match a provided regular
expression.</p>
<p>Note that this rule does not apply to non-private <code>Shared ReadOnly</code> fields, for which there is another rule.</p>
<p>The default configuration is:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Pascal casing, starting with an upper case character, e.g. BackColor </li>
  <li> Short abbreviations of 2 letters can be capitalized, e.g. GetID </li>
  <li> Longer abbreviations need to be lower cased, e.g. GetHtml </li>
</ul>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<p>With the default regular expression <code>^([A-Z]{1,3}[a-z0-9]+)*([A-Z]{2})?$</code>:</p>
<pre>
Class Foo
    Public foo As Integer  ' Noncompliant
End Class
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
Class Foo
    Public Foo As Integer  ' Compliant
End Class
</pre>
