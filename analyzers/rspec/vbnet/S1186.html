<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>An empty method is generally considered bad practice and can lead to confusion, readability, and maintenance issues. Empty methods bring no
functionality and are misleading to others as they might think the method implementation fulfills a specific and identified requirement.</p>
<p>Such methods should be avoided and possibly removed.</p>
<pre>
Sub DoSomething() ' Noncompliant
End Sub
</pre>
<p>However, there are some cases where a method needs to be empty. In those cases, it is essential to minimize confusion and enhance clarity.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The method will never be implemented.    By throwing the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.notsupportedexception"><code>NotSupportedException</code></a>, it makes clear the initial intention not to implement it in the future.  <pre>
Sub DoSomething() ' Compliant
    Throw New NotSupportedException
End Sub
</pre>   </li>
  <li> The method will be implemented in the future.    By throwing the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.notimplementedexception"><code>NotImplementedException</code></a>, the initial intention to add an implementation in the future is clear.  <pre>
Sub DoSomething() ' Compliant
    Throw New NotImplementedException
End Sub
</pre>   </li>
  <li> The method implementation is empty intentionally.    In this case, it is important to put a comment explaining the reason for the empty implementation.  <pre>
Sub DoSomething() ' Compliant
    ' Do nothing because of X
End Sub
</pre>   </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The following empty methods are considered compliant:</p>
<ul>
  <li> empty <code>Overridable</code> methods, as the implementation might not be required in the base class </li>
  <li> empty methods that override a <code>MustOverride</code> method as the implementation is mandatory for child class </li>
  <li> empty overrides in test assemblies for mocking purposes </li>
</ul>
