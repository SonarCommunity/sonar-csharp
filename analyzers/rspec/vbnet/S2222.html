<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>If a lock is held or acquired and then released within a method, it should be released along all execution paths.</p>
<p>Failing to do so could make an application deadlock-prone because there is a risk of the lock not being released.</p>
<p>The types tracked by the rule are: <code>Monitor</code>, <code>Mutex</code>, <code>ReaderWriterLock</code>, <code>ReaderWriterLockSlim</code>, and
<code>SpinLock</code> from the <code>System.Threading</code> namespace.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a lock is acquired in a method but only released on some paths. No issue is raised when the lock is never released
in the method. The assumption is that callers will release it.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
Class Example
    Private obj As Object = New Object()

    Public Sub DoSomethingWithMonitor()
        Monitor.Enter(obj) ' Noncompliant

        If IsInitialized() Then
            ' ..
            Monitor.Exit(obj)
        End If
    End Sub

    Private lockObj As ReaderWriterLockSlim = New ReaderWriterLockSlim()

    Public Sub DoSomethingWithReaderWriteLockSlim()
        lockObj.EnterReadLock() ' Noncompliant
        If IsInitialized() Then
            ' ..
            lockObj.ExitReadLock()
        End If
    End Sub
End Class
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
Class Example
    Private obj As Object = New Object()

    Public Sub DoSomethingWithMonitor()
        SyncLock obj ' is easier to use than explicit Monitor calls
            If IsInitialized() Then
            End If
        End SyncLock
    End Sub

    Private lockObj As ReaderWriterLockSlim = New ReaderWriterLockSlim()

    Public Sub DoSomethingWithReaderWriteLockSlim()
        lockObj.EnterReadLock()

        Try
            If IsInitialized() Then
            End If
        Finally
            lockObj.ExitReadLock()
        End Try
    End Sub
End Class
