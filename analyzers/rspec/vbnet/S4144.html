<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Two methods having the same implementation are suspicious. It might be that something else was intended. Or the duplication is intentional, which
becomes a maintenance burden.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
Private Const CODE As String = "bounteous"
Private callCount As Integer = 0

Public Function GetCode() As String
  callCount = callCount + 1
  Return CODE
End Function

Public Function GetName() As String ' Noncompliant: duplicates GetCode
  callCount = callCount + 1
  Return CODE
End Function
</pre>
<p>If the identical logic is intentional, the code should be refactored to avoid duplication. For example, by having both methods call the same method
or by having one implementation invoke the other.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>Empty methods, methods with only one line of code and methods with the same name (overload) are ignored.</p>
