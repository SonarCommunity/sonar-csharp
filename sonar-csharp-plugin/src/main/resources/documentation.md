## Language-Specific Properties

Discover and update the C#-specific [properties](/analysis/analysis-parameters/) in: <!-- sonarcloud -->Project <!-- /sonarcloud --> **[Administration > General Settings > C#](/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings?category=c%23)**.

### Analyze Generated Code

To analyze tool-generated code (e.g. WCF code generated by `SvcUtil.exe`, protobuf code generated by `protoc`, Swagger client code generated by `NSwag`) for a specific C# project, enable the "Analyze generated code" setting inside **Project > Administration > General Settings > C#**. By default, tool-generated code files are skipped from analysis.

Generated code detection is based on file name, special comments and attributes. Currently recognized values are in [GeneratedCodeRecognizer.cs](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet/blob/master/analyzers/src/SonarAnalyzer.Common/Helpers/GeneratedCodeRecognizer.cs).

## Scanner compatibility

To analyze C# code, you need to use the [SonarScanner for .NET](/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-msbuild/) version 4.x or newer.

## Exclusions

Files excluded from analysis should be set in a project configuration. This exclusion still performs the analysis on the file and filters final results.

As an alternative, `.editorconfig` file can be used to disable analysis for a specific rule on a file or directory. This can solve performance problems on large files.

```
[Path/File.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.Sxxx.severity = none
```
