<p>Uncompressing archive files is security-sensitive. For example, uncompressing archive files has led in the past to the following
vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1263">CVE-2018-1263</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16131">CVE-2018-16131</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Applications that uncompress archive files (zip, tar, jar, war, 7z, ...) should verify the path where the archive's files are uncompressed and not
trust blindly the content of the archive. Archive's files should not be uncompressed outside of the root directory where the archive is supposed to be
uncompressed. Also, applications should control the size of the uncompressed data to not be a victim of Zip Bomb attack. Failure to do so could allow
an attacker to use a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal paths (e.g. ../../attacker.sh) or the attacker could overload the file
system, processors or memory of the operating system where the archive is uncompressed making the target OS completely unusable.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when code uncompresses archives. The goal is to guide security code reviews.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> there is no validation of the name of the archive entry </li>
  <li> there is no validation of the effective path where the archive entry is going to be uncompressed </li>
  <li> there is no validation of the size of the uncompressed archive entry </li>
  <li> there is no validation of the ratio between the compressed and uncompressed archive entry </li>
</ul>
<p>You are at risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Validate the full path of the extracted file against the full path of the directory where files are uncompressed.</p>
<ul>
  <li> the canonical path of the uncompressed file must start with the canonical path of the directory where files are extracted. </li>
  <li> the name of the archive entry must not contain "..", i.e. reference to a parent directory. </li>
</ul>
<p>Stop extracting the archive if any of its entries has been tainted with a directory traversal path.</p>
<p>Define and control the ratio between compressed and uncompress bytes.</p>
<p>Define and control the maximum allowed uncompressed file size.</p>
<p>Count the number of file entries extracted from the archive and abort the extraction if their number is greater than a predefined threshold.</p>
<h2>Questionable Code Example</h2>
<pre>
For Each entry As ZipArchiveEntry in archive.Entries
    ' entry.FullName could contain parent directory references ".." and the destinationPath variable could become outside of the desired path
    string destinationPath = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(path, entry.FullName))
    entry.ExtractToFile(destinationPath) ' Questionable, extracts the entry to a file

    Dim stream As Stream
    stream = entry.Open() ' Questionable, the entry is about to be extracted
Next
</pre>
