<p>Hashing data is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-9233">CVE-2018-9233</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5097">CVE-2013-5097</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1051">CVE-2007-1051</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Cryptographic hash functions are used to uniquely identify information without storing their original form. When not done properly, an attacker can
steal the original information by guessing it (ex: with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow table</a>), or replace the
original data with another one having the same hash.</p>
<p>This rule flags code that initiates hashing.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> the hashed value is used for security purpose. </li>
  <li> the hashing algorithm you are using is known to have vulnerabilities. </li>
  <li> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">"salt"</a> is not added to the input before hashing. </li>
  <li> the salt value is always the same, or it is not random, or it is reused. </li>
  <li> the salt is shorter than the resulting hash value. </li>
</ul>
<p>You are at risk if you answered yes to the first question and any of the following ones.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> use only hashing algorithms which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function_security_summary">known to be strong</a>. Check
  regularly that this is still the case as hashing algorithms strength change with time. Do not define your own Hashing algorithms as they will most
  probably have flaws. </li>
  <li> generate a long random salt. </li>
  <li> the salt is at least as long as the resulting hash value. </li>
  <li> append the value being hashed to the salt and pass the whole thing into a standard hash function such as SHA256. </li>
  <li> save both the salt and the hashed value in the relevant database record; during future validation operations, the salt and hash can then be
  retrieved from the database. The hash is recalculated with the stored salt and the value being validated, and the result compared to the stored
  hash. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Questionable Code Example</h2>
<pre>
using System.Security.Cryptography;

void ComputeHash()
{
    // Review all instantiations of classes that inherit from HashAlgorithm, for example:
    HashAlgorithm hashAlgo = HashAlgorithm.Create(); // Questionable
    HashAlgorithm hashAlgo2 = HashAlgorithm.Create("SHA1"); // Questionable
    SHA1 sha = new SHA1CryptoServiceProvider(); // Questionable
    MD5 md5 = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider(); // Questionable
    // ...
}

class MyHashAlgorithm : HashAlgorithm // Questionable
{
    // ...
}
</pre>
