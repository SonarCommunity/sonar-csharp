<p>A proper implementation of <code>IDisposable.Dispose</code> should allow for it to be called multiple times on the same object, however this is not
guaranteed and could result in an exception being thrown.</p>
<p>It is best not to rely on this behavior and therefore make sure an object is disposed only once on all execution paths. This is particularly true
when dealing with nested <code>using</code> statements.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Examples</h2>
<pre>
using (var d = new Disposable()) // Noncompliant
{
    d.Dispose();
}
</pre>
<pre>
using var d = new Disposable();
d.Dispose(); // Noncompliant {{Refactor this code to make sure 'd' is disposed only once.}}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
using var d = new Disposable();
</pre>
