<p>Sending HTTP requests is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8150">CVE-2014-8150</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000007">CVE-2018-1000007</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0660">CVE-2010-0660</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>An HTTP request has different kinds of vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> it sends data which might be intercepted or dangerous. </li>
  <li> it receives a response which might have been crafted by an attacker. </li>
  <li> as each request opens a socket and triggers some processing for the sender and the recipient, it is possible to exhaust resources on both sides
  by sending too many requests. </li>
</ul>
<p>This rule flags code that initiates an HTTP request. The goal is to guide security code reviews.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> the http connection is encrypted or not. </li>
  <li> the recipient is not allowed to receive some of the data you send. </li>
  <li> the data sent might be dangerous (example: it contains unvalidated user input). </li>
  <li> an uncontrolled number of requests might be sent. For example, a request might be sent every time a user performs an action, and this action is
  not limited. </li>
</ul>
<p>You are at risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> First, it is important to encrypt all HTTP connection if there is any chance for them to be eavesdropped. Use HTTPS whenever possible. </li>
  <li> Ensure that you control the URIs you send requests to and the number or requests you send. Your software could otherwise be used to attack
  other services. </li>
  <li> Avoid sending sensitive information, be it in the URL, header or body. If part of the data comes from an untrusted source, such as a user
  input, sanitize it beforehand. </li>
  <li> Validate and sanitize the response before using it in any way. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Questionable Code Example</h2>
<pre>

' All the following are Questionable
client.GetAsync(...)
client.GetByteArrayAsync(...)

Dim webclient As System.Net.WebClient
' All the following are Questionable, although they may be false positives if the URI scheme is "ftp" or "file"
webclient.Download*(...) ' Any method starting with "Download"
webclient.Open*(...) ' Any method starting with "Open"
webclient.Upload*(...) ' Any method starting with "Upload"

' All the following are Questionable, although they may be false positives if the URI scheme is "ftp" or "file"
System.Net.WebRequest.Create(...)
System.Net.WebRequest.CreateDefault(...)

' The following is always Questionable
System.Net.WebRequest.CreateHttp(...)

' === RestSharp ===
' Questionable, as well as any other instantiation of the RestSharp.IRestRequest interface.
