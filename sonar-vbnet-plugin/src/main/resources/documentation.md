## Language-Specific Properties

Discover and update the VB.NET-specific [properties](/analysis/analysis-parameters/) in: <!-- sonarcloud -->Project <!-- /sonarcloud --> **[Administration > General Settings > VB.NET](/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings?category=vb.net)**

### Analyze Generated Code

To analyze tool-generated code (e.g. WCF code generated by `SvcUtil.exe`) for a specific VB.NET project, enable the "Analyze generated code" setting inside **Project > Administration > General Settings > VB.NET**. By default, tool-generated code files are skipped from analysis.

Generated code detection is based on file name, special comments and attributes. Currently recognized values are in [GeneratedCodeRecognizer.cs](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet/blob/master/analyzers/src/SonarAnalyzer.Common/Helpers/GeneratedCodeRecognizer.cs).

## Scanner compatibility

To analyze VB.NET code, you need to use the [SonarScanner for .NET](/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-msbuild/) version 4.x or newer.

## Exclusions

Files excluded from analysis should be set in a project configuration. This exclusion still performs the analysis on the file and filters final results.

As an alternative, `.editorconfig` file can be used to disable analysis for a specific rule on a file or directory. This can solve performance problems on large files.

```
[Path/File.vb]
dotnet_diagnostic.Sxxx.severity = none
```

## Known Limitations

Currently an error will be thrown when an issue is raised on a line of code containing the following pattern `\s+error\s*:` (i.e. one or more spaces, the string 'error', zero or more spaces and a ':' ) . This is a well known problem on the Microsoft side (see [issue](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/5724/)). In order to work around this problem, analysis will skip issues reported on any line where the pattern is detected.
