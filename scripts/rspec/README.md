# General info

The `rspec.ps1` script downloads and calls the rule-api JAR.

The `sonarpedia.json` file is used by:
- the releasability check
- rules.sonarsource.com

# How to use

Script must be run from project root directory. For more details, you can read the powershell code inside `rspec.ps1`.

**Usage 1**: Update all rules or language metadata. 

Basically, the rule-api JAR will update: `sonarway_profile*`, `*.html` and `*.json`, `sonarpedia.json`.

```
./scripts/rspec/rspec cs
./scripts/rspec/rspec vbnet
```

**Usage 2**: Pull metadata (replace or create) for single rule.

`sonarway_profile*` will not be updated!

```
./scripts/rspec/rspec cs S1234
```

**Usage 3**: Like *Usage 2*, but also creates scaffolding.

- Should not be used to update, just to create a new rule (including to create the `vbnet` impl for an existing `cs` rule).
- For updates, use *Usage 1* or *Usage 2*.

```
./scripts/rspec/rspec cs S1234 ClassName
```

# Possible improvements

- For *Usage 3*, check in the script if the scaffolding has already been created and stop if so, issuing a warning message. Currently, running *Usage 3* twice messes up the scaffolding.
- Change the hardcoded ruleapi link with the environment variable that is now on all computers.
