# Issue tracking

All issues for SonarC\# and SonarVB are tracked using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet/issues).

You're welcome to submit any issue that you've found using these plugins. Please provide minimal reproducible example for each case.

## Labels

Labels are divided into several categories. Single issue can contain:

* multiple labels from Area category,
* only one label from Status category,
* only one label from Type category.

## Implicit rules

* Any issue without labels needs review.
* Every issue containing labels is confirmed.
