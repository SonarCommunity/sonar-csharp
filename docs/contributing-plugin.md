# Building, Testing and Debugging the SonarQube plugin

## Working with the code

First or all you need to clone SonarC# repository: https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-csharp.git.

SonarC# plugin relies on some metadata generated by the dotnet analyzer (part of the msbuild compilation).

To build the plugin by embedding the dotnet analyzer that was built locally, use the following command:

    mvn clean install -P local-analyzer -D analyzer.configuration=Debug

The other alternative is to rely on an already built version of the analyzer using the following command:

    mvn clean install -P download-analyzer -D analyzer.version=6.1.0.2070

This option is useful for developers in Unix, who don't build the C# analyzer themselves, because they work on other
parts of the plugin.

External users can rely only on public versions hosted in maven
[org.sonarsource.dotnet:SonarAnalyzer.CSharp](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.sonarsource.dotnet/SonarAnalyzer.CSharp)
